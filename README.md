# Liars dice
A game about lying

THE GOAL:
Be the last player to still have dice left at the end of the game

THE GAME:
Players takes turns betting on how many dice of each number they believe exist in the game
Each player knows only the dice in thier possesion
Before betting, a player may choose to DOUBT the bet of the previous player
  If the previous player lied, that previous player loses a die
  If the previous player told the truth, the doubting player loses a die
When a player declares a DOUBT, the round is over:
   The loser must remove one die and
   All players reroll their dice
   The player who lost a die bets first and betting continues clockwise

BETTING:
While placing a bet, a player is betting on how many dice exist in the game: 
        This includes both the player's dice, and all opponents' dice
A bet must be higher in either QUANTITY or NUMBER than the current bet
   ex:  A bet of four 5s is higher than a bet of four 4s
        A bet of five 5s is also higher than a bet of four 4s
A bet that is higher in QUANTITY is ALWAYS higher, even if it is lower in number
  ex:   A bet of three 1s is higher than a bet of two 6s
When a player is out of dice, he or she is eliminated
  
TIPS: 
As you lose dice, you have less information about the game, so it is useful to maintain the maximum number of dice as long as possible
